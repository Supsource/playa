1. **Sign Up or Log In:** Create an account and set your preferences.
2. **Discover Games:** Find games or players nearby using the location feature.
3. **Create or Join:** Start your own game or join one that fits your schedule.
4. **Book & Pay:** Reserve venues and make payments in cash upon arrival.
5. **Play Together:** Show up, have fun, and make new connections!

## 🚀 What’s Next?
